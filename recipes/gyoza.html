    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Crispy on the bottom, juicy on the inside, and bursting with savory goodness, <strong>gyoza</strong> are Japanese dumplings filled with a delightful mix of ground meat, veggies, and bold seasonings. With each bite, they deliver a satisfying crunch followed by a soft, flavorful interior, perfect for dipping in a zesty soy-vinegar sauce.</p>

        <li>Mix well till all ingredients are throughly combined.</li>
        <li>Place a gyoza wrapper on the palm of your non-dominant hand. Dip your finger in water and run your fingers around the edge to wet the edge of the wrapper.</li>
        <li>Place 1 slightly heaping teaspoon of filling into the center of the wrapper and create 4 folds along the top of the gyoza so to seal the top.</li>

        <li>Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Place gyoza in the pan in a circle, working inwards from the outside. Continue until no more space to place gyoza remain.  </li>
        <li>Cook until the underside is lightly brown.</li>
        <li>Add 1/3 cup of water and then cover with a lid until all of the water has evaporated (add extra water if the wrapper is not fully cooked).</li>
        <li>Flip onto large plate and enjoy with your favourite dipping sauce.</li>
